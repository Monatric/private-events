# Project: Private Events

This project has similar functionalities to [EventBrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and manage user registrations. 

A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).

This project will require me to model many-to-many relationships and also to be very conscious about my foreign keys and class names. The learning outcome of this project should enable me to strongly grasp Active Record Associations and Queries.

The project is guided by the Rails course in [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-private-events).
